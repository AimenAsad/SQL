## üìä ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) Design

The ERD forms the backbone of this database project, illustrating the relationships between various entities in the airplane and owner management system.

* **Owner (Superclass):** Considered a superclass, disjointly dividing into `Corporate` and `Person` subclasses, as an owner can be either.
* **Person (Subclass):** Further subdivided into `Employee` and `Pilot`, inheriting features from the `Person` class. Necessary attributes are identified for each.
* **Relationships:**
    * `Owns`: Links the `Owner` superclass to `Airplane` with a `purchase_date` attribute.
    * `Maintains`: Establishes a one-to-many relationship between `Employee` and `Service Record`.
    * `Plane Service`: Indicates that an `Airplane` can undergo maintenance multiple times.
    * `Airplane`, `Plane Type`, and `Hangar` information is stored in separate, linked classes.
* Primary and foreign keys are used throughout to establish robust links between all classes.
